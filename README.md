# mcb

this repo contains a compiler for the mc-build language. its a language designed to allow creating datapackss in a smaller number of files with some more convienences.

this project is not yet at a stable state, use with caution.

please feel free to leave issues for feature requests though I'm not going to garantee they will be used.
